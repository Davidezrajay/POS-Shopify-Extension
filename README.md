## Tech Stack

This app combines a number of third party open-source tools:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) builds the backend.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) builds the [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for routing. We wrap this with file-based routing.
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) queries the Admin API.
- [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) and related libraries are used to internationalize the frontend.
  - [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/) is used for React-specific i18n functionality.
  - [`i18next-resources-to-backend`](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-resources-to-backend) is used to dynamically load app translations.
  - [`@formatjs/intl-localematcher`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-localematcher/) is used to match the user locale with supported app locales.
  - [`@formatjs/intl-locale`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-locale) is used as a polyfill for [`Intl.Locale`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale) if necessary.
  - [`@formatjs/intl-pluralrules`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-pluralrules) is used as a polyfill for [`Intl.PluralRules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules) if necessary.

The following Shopify tools complement these third-party tools to ease app development:

- [Shopify API library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) adds OAuth to the Express backend. This lets users install the app and grant scope permissions.
- [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started/using-react) adds authentication to API requests in the frontend and renders components outside of the Appâ€™s iFrame.
- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.
- [Custom hooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/tree/main/hooks) make authenticated requests to the Admin API.
- [File-based routing](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/blob/main/Routes.jsx) makes creating new pages easier.
- [`@shopify/i18next-shopify`](https://github.com/Shopify/i18next-shopify) is a plugin for [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) that allows translation files to follow the same JSON schema used by Shopify [app extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/checkout/best-practices/localizing-ui-extensions#how-it-works) and [themes](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/locales/storefront-locale-files#usage).
